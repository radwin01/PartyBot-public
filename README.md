# ðŸŽ‰ PartyBot ðŸŽ‰
A fun-filled party bot to liven up discord servers! ðŸ¥³

## Games/Commands ðŸŽ‰
Currently, there are three fun games for you to try out with PartyBot! (prefix to use before every command: '-')
<ul>
<li> Random Number Generator (rng): A number from 1-100 (inclusive) is picked. You and PartyBot will guess a 
number, and whoever is closer to the real number wins! </li>
<li> Twenty One (21): You and PartyBot will take turns picking either 1, 2 or 3. The person that is forced to land on 21 loses! </li>
<li> Rock Paper Scissors (rps): You and PartyBot will play a classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. (don't worry, PartyBot promises not to cheat ðŸ˜‰) </li>
</ul>
Furthermore, you have the chance to register yourself to the leaderboard system using the command reg. Once you are registered, you will be able to win (or lose) points and see yourself on the leaderboard!
To view the leaderboard, use the command ldbd. <br />
(you may also use the command help for PartyBot to display the list of current command descriptions, in case you forget)

<b> Since PartyBot is deployed on a free plan, the number of servers it can join is currently limited. Thus, in the public repo for PartyBot, the token is currently hidden. However, if you would like to add PartyBot to animate your own server, please feel free to <a href="mailto:y9rdwn0110@gmail.com"> email me</a>! </b>
